# TDI - Tabbed Document Interface

Is the interface popularly known as tabbed browsing.
This pattern allows multiple child windows to be created within the main application screen.

This component was created by me around 2005/2006 to meet needs in the creation of screens more
organized for the ERP SIGData.

At the time hardly anyone used this methodology, I believe only Firefox browsers and was when Microsoft
was inspired to adopt the same technique in Internet Explorer 7 as well.


How to install:

Compile and install the package: JcTDIForm.Package.dpk
Add the JcTDIForm.pas file in the Library path
